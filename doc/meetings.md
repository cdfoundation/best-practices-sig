# CDF SIG-Best-Practices

[Agenda in HackMD](https://hackmd.io/uxoIwj7fTjKkI161-IZeFw)

## 24-January-2022
- Attendees:
    - Tara Hernandez (Google)
    - Terry Cox
    - Nicola Yap (Google)
    - Vaidik Kapoor
    - Jalandar

- Agenda
    - Netlify process working session.  Steps!
        - Pull the source:
            - ```git clone --recurse-submodules fork-of-https://github.com/cdfoundation/best-practices-site```
        - Test locally via Docker container (maybe? might be better to use non-containerized local Hugo install). Steps here:
            - https://preview-site-cdf-bp.netlify.app/community/contribute/ 
        - Need to sort out dependency checking (local and upstream)
        - Regen netlify invites for Tara (incomplete registration)
        - Set up a tracking doc to capture any formatting notes or other site display/user experience - Tara to do this 
            - having text highlights enclosed in a box vs. just a orange line highlight
            - single page vs. multi-page content and supporting different narratifve paths through the content
                - multi-page gives advantage of bringing more detail to TOC and easier bookmarking
                - Nicola suggests being creative with tags as a way of helping with this.
        - There's apparently a way to invite 'reviewers' vs. 'contributors' to netlify, reviewers would be able to see and help with PR reviews without consuming a license.
        - We still need a proper domain/brand for the site as well

- Agenda
    - Mauricio looking to contribute this [repo](https://github.com/salaboy/from-monolith-to-k8s) to CDF, Nicola recommending including principles in main site, and under community section put explicit implemention examples.  Action item to followup on this next meeting.
    - Staging "preview" site now up [here](https://preview-site-cdf-bp.netlify.app/community/).  Tracy to add more contributors to CDF Netlify account so they can take advantage of using the staging functionality. 
    - Interoperability SIG and Tekton group has been kicking around glossaries and translations of terms and how they're used between different solutions.  Action item to come up with how best to incorporate this into info architecture.
        - [Glossary](https://github.com/cdfoundation/glossary/blob/main/definitions.md)
        - [Rosetta Stone](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/vocabulary.md)
    - Also, we need to figure out a brand for the final published site.  Tracy will organize a followup meeting and is reaching out to strategy group for suggestions.
    - Ann Marie mentions that there are two PRs on the interoperability vocabularay content that are influenced by IBM's "One Pipeline" attestation process, describes the steps (and terminology around those steps) that can be useful for any company/project to conform to a regulatory attestation. The hope is that the phases (regardless of they may be described) can be viewed consistently.
        - https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/pull/76
        - https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/pull/81
        - Terry points out that that we may need to consolidate terms between Best Practices and Interoperability SIGs

        - Nicola will include instructions on how to do local versions using Docker, will create auto publish probably via Netfify
        - Also agreement on things like image files use SVG format, to start 
    - Justin interested in capturing notes from engaging in DevOps best practices efforts at eBay -- first official use case?
    - Can we also come up with a good tagging model for documents to improve discoverability e.g.
        - "here's how Foo company assessed and improved their automated testing needs involving performance stress tests", is tagged to relevant section test best practices overview docs
        - Nicole thinks this is doable
    - Proposal to add some sort of discussion around organizational maturity and how that impacts approaches to continuous delivery and DevOps best pratices.
        - e.g. Agile product driven approaches vs. large legacy enterprise vs. cloud native/greenfield
        - Having ability to map a company to a model could help them understand best places to start?
        - [SLSA model](https://slsa.dev/levels) has concepts around this from a "security levels", could we expand this a bit possibly from the perspective of "what problems are you trying to solve, does CD/DevOps helps with this"

                        4. Secure production
                    - Too specific?
                        - Currently have a TODO item for security in the context of governance in the doc, could follow up with specific examples in hands on portion of doc

- Agenda:
    - Looking at results for survey about time: https://forms.gle/fqtVGCrm2uFsUxmh8 (Christie can't attend today but Tracy Miranda and Tara should have edit access@)
        - Results so far: 9am PST / 12pm EST is the top choice, but only for 5/7, if anyone absolutely can't do this time plz mention this, we can expand to include other days
    - Looks like we should have a BoaF spot at cdCon, Tracy to confirm date/time (hopefully a time that works for Terry)
    - Need an outline "content/copy" -- set of links to github/docs that a landing page can point at for all working groups/SIGs.
        - Capture idea of "personas" for which content can be tailored, e.g. an exec level explanation vs. a developer level.
        - Suggestions from outeach committee: https://st1.zoom.us/web_client/f3jfhf/html/externalLinkPage.html?ref=https://github.com/cdfoundation/outreach/blob/main/personas.md
            - Possible exercise, flag the [best practices doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#heading=h.9ji2tp1suza) with the persona categories/roles?

## 03-May-2021
- Attendees:
    - Christie Wilson
    - Terry Cox
    - Tara Hernandez
    - Gopinath Rebala

- Agenda:
    - IEEE have launched a standard for devops: 2675
        - https://standards.ieee.org/standard/2675-2021.html
            - - https://www.researchgate.net/project/IEEE-2675-DevOps-standard
        - Launch meeting: what is devops? hard to answer!
            - Any opportunity for us to help out?
                - Terry Cox is going to be in next sitting of the working group
    - What is our Best Pratices audience?
        - Needs to be everyone; way we provide the info is almost as important as the info itself
            - Need to be able to read the info at the context/level that is relevant for you, without
              having to leave
                - Individual implementor vs. decision maker, need different granularity of detail but
                  it's all part of the same story
                - Important to go both broad and deep
                    - Need to drive solid awareness regardless of your role
    - Process that leads to these methodologies:
        - Startups are motivated to innovate (e.g. silicon valley)
        - These folks move around to different companies, spread the ideas around
        - Media hears about it, spreads the ideas, gives it labels
        - People start trying to apply the methodologies but without the context they need
            - Why are we doing this and in what circumstances
        - People say 'this is the next big thing' but it's not working, so they fiddle with it
          and redefine it, and then it means what they're already doing
    - [Best practices doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#heading=h.9ji2tp1suza)
        - Can we create this multi directional context for each bit in the doc?
            - e.g. "deployment frequency", frame this at both levels
                - exec level + technical practioner level
        - Narrative: hero's journey
                - Start with: this is the problem we're trying to solve
                - Refusual: i dont want to do this
                - Realization : i have to engage with this
            - Need to flesh out the journey so it's easy to understand
        - What kind of assumptions can we make about folks coming to the CDF?
            - e.g. Christie in her book assuming people have some tests/unit tests
                - Tara: last company, folks saying "can't write tests yet, not done implementing"
        - Next steps?
            - Create a [scratch section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#bookmark=id.70jtt4iov1il)
              that reminds us what we're trying to flesh out
            - Views + viewpoints, depending on who the stakeholder is, they'll have a different
              perspective
        - Making organizational change happen
            - So different for different departments; some inherently invested in the status quo
            - At an exec level: things like, retraining, paying for vendors
        - Realistically many organizations will not be able to implement devops
            - Don't want to paint ourselves into a corner
            - Maybe from the perspective of folks moving into microservices and the cloud, vs for their
              huge quantities of existing software
            - Start with: contexts in which devops was designed to be used, for our first iteration
                - Not trying to boil the ocean; consistent story
                - Next: implications of wanting to introduce some elements of devops to existing software
                  and processes
                - Mismatch b/w ppl who think they are doing devops and folks who are actually capable
                  of doing devops
        

- Action Items:
    - Christie can send survey about different time (more PST friendly hopefully?)

## 19-Apr-2021
- Attendees:
    - Christie Wilson
    - Kara de la Marck
    - Tara Hernandez
    - Terry Cox
    - Tracy Miranda
    - Gopinath Rebala
    - Siddarth Pareek

- Agenda:
    - Updates to [best practices doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#heading=h.9ji2tp1suza) by Terry Cox
        - Specifically narrative lead in: why ppl need to be doing best practices, contexts, etc.: [Understanding the problem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#heading=h.o7uo3njnwqti)
        - Related effort: presentation around 4 key DORA metrics, etc., Tracy Miranda doing a write up, includes similar topics, Tracy to look at how to combine the contents
        - Thinking about audience: technical ppl already deeply involved (i.e. can skip a lot) vs ppl who know it exists but are missing the background that drives the reasoning
        - Tracy would like to create a blog post from some of this content early and get feedback
            - First need agreement on picture trying to paint and style
        - What is the scope of this doc? CI, CD, deployments, etc.?
            - All of it
    - Tracy merged [initial CD definitions](https://github.com/cdfoundation/glossary/blob/main/definitions.md#continuous-delivery-definitions), planning to give these a trial run
        - Context of these definitions? Alignment with best practices doc?
            - Can see history in PRs + doc links in those descriptions: https://github.com/cdfoundation/glossary/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed
                - WIP to finesse the definitions in the best practices doc and the glossary to be aligned (see comments in doc)
    - Do we want a Birds of a Feather at cdCon?
        - yes, what scope? e.g. dora metrics as well?
            - Mulitple audiences, makes sense to have a general session and more targetted sessions
                - e.g. 100 + 400 (intro and advanced tracks)
        - anything specific to cover? or general?
            - e.g. branching and merging strategies, or at the level of "CI", "deployments"
                - branching: do you develop in a branch or on mainline with feature flags
                    - entire discussion worthy of its own category
                    - process for getting started, vs. benefits you can buy with a more complex strategy
            - could be interesting to talk about all the different ways folks are approaching CD and adopting it
            - justifying CD to management with a better argument than "because netflix"
                - Huge mismatch in communication around what it takes to effectively use CD
                - Need to provide the entry level communication for ppl to grasp onto so they can start on this journey (in addition to providing the more advanced info)
        - how long until cdCon?
            - 1 month
        - CDF should be able to speak to the maturity of "all the things" entailed in developing a software delivery lifecycle
            - can we do an industry survey to see who's using what (as far as tools, processes)
            - github, stackoverflow surveys may have some of this data
        - Siddarth raises the issue of compliance as a critical element that needs focus, particularly for high regulatory industries like finance and healthcare
            - Terry points out that many companies are more heavily invested in manual approaches to this (and in fact may cause resistance to automating this due to perceived negative impact on job security).
            - Interoperability SIG has started exploring this idea, looking at https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa e.g. We probably want to have security compliance as its own set of sections in definitions and best practices.

- Action Items:
    - All to please review [Understanding the problem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#heading=h.o7uo3njnwqti) **by end of the week**
    - Please take a look at [initial CD definitions](https://github.com/cdfoundation/glossary/blob/main/definitions.md#continuous-delivery-definitions), discussions are on in the repo for feedback (or comment on original PR)

        - 

## 08-Mar-2021
- Attendees:
    - Tracy Miranda
    - Thomas Schuetz
    - Terry Cox
    - Siddharth Pareek
    
- Agenda:
    - Christie can't attend, can someone else handle [the agenda and notes?](https://hackmd.io/uxoIwj7fTjKkI161-IZeFw)
    - [CD definitions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IUSmgtw5eC2JwyfiX7IPK3twl3MSjWAsmCKmJ6Y5z-w/edit#)
        - Christie created an initial PR: https://github.com/cdfoundation/glossary/pull/10
    - [Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#heading=h.9ji2tp1suza) should become the methodologies used to define the definitions from the CD definitions docs 
        - This needs the 'why' and 'definition' sections completed before we push it to the repo/markdown
        - Terry Cox has reference docs that he can pull a lot of these out
        - Another concept to consider: "scale appropriate fit" as it pertains to size of the problem. e.g. a single Jenkins instance can easily support a small to medium size team.  You also wouldn't use Spinnaker in a small to medium scoped problem. Can we create guidance to help evaluate their needs. Another element of this is understanding the evolution of this -- it's done in steps promted by growth of the team/product size as well as the advancement of technology.
- Action Items:
    - Terry Cox will update Best Practices doc on "why/definitions"

                - Assuming not one size fits all
            - Highlighted key areas that are part of continuous delivery
                - Ideally ppl can look at the list and see where they are at; live maturity model
            - Useful list for evangelizing key practices in your organization
        - Tracy Ragan:
            - This group can't do all of the above, needs to be pushed to community
            - Need to start a framework, bring in ambassadors, end users, to expand
                - Website is key
                    - Need to create a brand around the CD foundation, align ourselves as thought leaders and go to place for information
                        - Confusion in the industry, e.g. forbes article, ppl confusing Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment
            - Description + scope = boring, wanted to frame as a story to have more context and depth
            - Docker specific best practices: maybe need to have a different category for CI/CD in a docker world
        - Next steps:
            - Add comments?
                - Prefer just changing it directly + rewrite it
                    - Suggestions? Need some kind of review to make sure we're on the same page
                        - Create a basic structure = fine
                        - This group can't create this info, need a bigger approach, beyond our walls, need to bring in more eyes
                            - Create a process for reviewing and approving PRs?
                            - Need a small group to put initial content forward
        - Thoughts from newer folks, how does this fit with your expectations? (Anthony)
            - Anthony: Problems currently: e.g. getting branching strategy up and running (lots of different opinions), how does that work with CI/CD going forward, how do you apporach a pull request
                - Wish something like this already existed! :D
            - Anthony: Docker containers: a bit specific, depends on what you're doing at what stage
                - multi stage docker build = important conversation, changes workflows
                    - CDF = exciting right now b/c things are in flux, don't want to get to stuck in the past, i.e. cloud native vs traditional
                        - Should have whole section on cloud native CI/CD
                            - To reduce scope = don't try to do both
            - Much bigger project: need to get it out there to more ppl
                - ppl in different industries will have completely different ways of doing things and guardrails
        - Everything is so connected, hard not to define something (e.g. CI vs version control section), hard to talk about one section without referring to another
            - Just focus on definitions
        - Website
            - = best practices?
                - Just way to present best practices?
                    - Website can have history, etc.
        - Best practices don't belong here
            - Best practices are siloed by industry, defined by verticals
            - Create standard doc with definition and scope
                - What is version control, what is CI, what is CD
                    - Create a way for best practices to be expanded by industry segments
                        - Website = create open source community to write this via pull requests
                            - This group reviews PRs
                            - Funds for having other ppl do the editing?
                            - Don't just want us to curate the info
        - Can use this group to determine:
            - Structure of this information
        - Does take curation and structure to have something that is contributed to by so many people
            - Balance between: making it so folks can contribute, and keeping it focused
        - Thoughts from newer folks, how does this fit with your expectations? (Thomas)
            -  Thomas:
                -  Would love to see best practices for CD
                -  Many questions:
                    - Versioning + Continuous testing, when are you testing against which version, how can you guarantee that you test every contribution
                - Many people talk about these things but very hard to get the info you need
                - Currently working on a whitepaper about operators in the CNCF, hard to get ppl to contribute, in the end = hard work of few people
                - Agree that most needed = best pratices for CD in cloud native?
                    - Yes
                    - Mauricio: can start with definitions, ask ppl to chime in with their experiences
                        - Website: to start a discussion, need to have something to refer to
        - Are we interested in having example use cases or user stories?
            - e.g. Jenkins X has a nice way of handling testing version streams
            - Yes, every section should have case studies and tool based best practices
        - Need to pick the most impactful categories to detangle
            - Fill in A, B, C of the doc, then come up with a strategy for D and E
                - Won't be easy to get ppl to contribute, but building end user council, there are lots of ppl who want to be ambassadors
                - Once we have A, B and C, we can create some blog posts
                    - Do more evangelism?
                        - Keep it low key until we have a structure that makes it easier for ppl to contribute
        - Verticals, e.g. different areas such as MLOps, every group should be able to take our fundamentals (A, B, C) and be able to have their own best practices
            - = this is how we know we've succeeded
        - Need to figure out what table of contents will look like
            - Starting point = [Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7#heading=h.9ji2tp1suza)
                - Best practices should be broken up by industry (e.g. insurance, embedded, health care)
                    - Each vertical could have its own whole document, with it's own definitions
                        - White paper for each, e.g. verison control for finance
                        - Each has own neighborhood to have a conversation about what they think CD is
                            - e.g. gamers vs startup 
                                - What makes a startup different? size, budget, speed, reliance on open source
                                - What about ppl writing Python, etc.
        - Feels like we are increasing the scope a bit, start with A, B and C?
            - There will be a lot that verticals will have in common (e.g. running unit tests)
            - Get a basic structure out there
            - Have a strategy for how this can grow over time
        - Create an outline for best practices for CD for cloud native
            - Create an MVP, what would you have to do to make this apply to finance
                - Have more access to finance folks at the moment
            - Proposal:
                - 1. ABC lowest common denomniator best practices (regardless of industry)
                - 2. Continue discussing how to bring in the broader community in an open, transparent, everyone welcome way
        - Broad forums on advertised topics ahead of time? e.g. having someone come in and talk about how they are doing each
    - **Update on CI/CD Events Vocabulary new SIG**
        - Mauricio has been joining this group, have been pushing for describing the vocabulary for events
            - First meeting tomorrow with someone from Tekton
            - Want event category definition, event format, event content
        - Related: events that different tools use, how do these correlate with best practices
        - Standardized format = easier to discuss
        - Couple of ppl from Dynatrace in events working group also
    - **How to encorporate Best Practices into website updates**
        - (covered in best practices discussion?)
    - Do we want to convert [best practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DojwSRqlTrAoxfE6jp2U4_SIzpefGRfu1OhKYc6_-nQ/edit?ts=602167a7) to a markdown?
        - Can be easier to comment in doc in early stages
            - vs. PRs and discussions don't seem to get as much traction
        - hackmd?
        - maybe get all the ABCs into a clean doc, then convert to markdown and commit
            - Maybe include lowest common demoniator best practices; at least to have best practices section

- Action items
    - Update SIG best practices calendar with link to [HackMD agenda doc](https://hackmd.io/uxoIwj7fTjKkI161-IZeFw)

## 11-Jan-2021
- Plan: workshop CD Whitepaper topics

## 14-Dec-2020
- Mauricio has started use cases with a focus on what gets impacted when you make changes in a tech stack.  Will be following up with Interoperability SIG with regards to Events (which will probably be broken out into its own SIG)
    - Will review some of the talks from CDCon with related content, followups next year
- Christie has started a timeline of terms and when they came into existence, has a [PR pending review](https://github.com/cdfoundation/almanac/pull/1)

    - Can we refine existing list more usefully?  Next meeting will work on this.
    - Still need to organize the Ambassadors and/or determine whether we have sufficient data from members about their CD proccesses


## 30-Nov-2020

- Setup new SIG repo, ACLs! 
    - Tracy M to setup a Youtube playlist for future 'best practice' videos 
- Should followup w/Jacque about soliciting Ambassadors regarding generating list of case studies from respective organizations.
